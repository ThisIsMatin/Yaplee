## Introduction
The Yaplee framework can be synced with other web frameworks, and you can use Yaplee-created pages in other web frameworks. Yaplee has the ability to sync automatically and in just a few seconds you can sync your project with other frameworks

## Sync with Django
#### Automatic Sync :
To create an Yaplee project and sync it automatically with your Django project, first go to the main folder of your Django project (where manage.py is located) :

```bash
$ sudo django-admin startproject testproject
$ cd testproject/
```
Then create an Yaplee app here and set the sync argument to Django:
```bash
$ sudo yaplee new --sync django
```
Done! Your Django project is now synced with the Yaplee app.
### How it works ?
1. Create an Yaplee template first:
    ```python
    @myapp.template('main.html')
    def MainPage():
        return {}
    ```
    Note: Create a `main.html` file in django main folder (It is recommended to put the HTML files in a folder and organize the project).
2. Create a view in Django:
    ```python
    def home(request):
        return render(request, 'main.html')
    ```
    Then set this view (for example) to the project's main page:
    ```python
    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', home)
    ]
    ```
3. Done! Now start your Django project:
    ```bash
    $ sudo python3 manage.py runserver

    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
    ```

## Dockerizing
#### Using Dockerfile:
To dockerize a django project synced with Yaplee, you can do the following:
```bash
$ django-admin startproject project
$ cd project/
```
Create a Dockerfile and write your Dockerfile as an example in it:
```dockerfile
FROM python:latest

ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

WORKDIR /project

COPY . /project

RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python3", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```
Be sure to include the Django version and the libraries required by your project in requirements.txt and add 0.0.0.0 to the allowed hosts in settings.py

Because Yaplee has not yet been officially released, you can't write Yaplee's library name in your project ``requirements.txt``. So connect the yaplee to your project as follows and finally build your project â€Œ:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ThisIsMatin/Yaplee
$ cat ./Yaplee/requirements.txt >> requirements.txt
$ mv ./Yaplee/yaplee/ . && rm -rf ./Yaplee
$ sudo docker build --tag django/yaplee:1.0 .
```
* Your project is ready and you can run the Docker image now!
